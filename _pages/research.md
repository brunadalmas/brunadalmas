### From Shadows to Spotlight: The Power Dynamics Behind Transitional Justice Choices  
<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

What determines the choice of a transitional justice method? While the literature extensively covers the theoretical framework of transitional justice and its practical impact on human rights protection and the consolidation of democracy, it remains unclear how different forces interact in shaping accountability measures. Specifically, why do different countries adopt varied approaches, such as amnesty versus truth commissions? This paper examines the key determinants of transitional justice mechanisms. I argue that both a strong civil society and powerful armed forces play significant roles in these processes. By analyzing all countries with an authoritarian past using a fixed-effects model, I demonstrate that the strength of these actors significantly influences the likelihood of these events. Ultimately, this study emphasizes the importance of considering the interplay between these key actors to fully understand the dynamics of post-conflict accountability and the adoption of transitional justice measures.

### Ideology under Informal Rule: How Criminal Organizations Shape Electoral Outcomes  
<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

How do civilians vote when criminal organizations govern everyday life? This paper develops a voter-centered theory of electoral behavior under criminal governance. I argue that criminal territorial control shapes electoral outcomes by conditioning whether participation is feasible and, conditional on participation, which candidates voters support. Rather than treating turnout and vote choice as separate outcomes, the paper conceptualizes turnout as a mediating step that conditions electoral choice. Using neighborhood-level variation in criminal control over time, the study examines how voting behavior changes as neighborhoods transition between different forms of criminal governance. The paper contributes to literatures on clientelism, criminal governance, and violence by showing how elections remain usable, but constrained, political arenas under informal rule.

### Not All Justice Is Equal: Understanding Crime Outcomes Across Transitional Justice Mechanisms  
<details>
<summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

What is the effect of transitional justice mechanisms on post-conflict crime rates? The literature on transitional justice has successfully highlighted its benefits for democracy and security. Broadly speaking, transitional justice is associated with reductions in homicide rates. However, it remains unclear whether certain mechanisms are more effective than others in preventing crime. In this paper, I argue that the relationship between transitional justice and crime is shaped by the strength of each mechanism in promoting accountability and institutional reform. Specifically, countries that implement security sector reforms and criminal trials are more likely to achieve lower crime rates. Ultimately, this article emphasizes the complexity of transitional justice mechanisms and the variation in their societal impacts, particularly in their ability to prevent cycles of violence.
