  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

  What determines the choice of a transitional justice method? While the literature extensively covers the theoretical framework of transitional justice and its practical impact on human rights protection and the consolidation of democracy, it remains unclear how different forces interact in shaping accountability measures. Specifically, why do different countries adopt varied approaches, such as amnesty versus truth commissions? This paper examines the key determinants of transitional justice mechanisms. I argue that both a strong civil society and powerful armed forces play significant roles in these processes. By analyzing all countries with an authoritarian past using a fixed-effects model, I demonstrate that the strength of these actors significantly influences the likelihood of these events. Ultimately, this study emphasizes the importance of considering the interplay between these key actors to fully understand post-conflict accountability.

  <details>
  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

  How do civilians vote when criminal organizations govern everyday life? This paper develops a voter-centered theory of electoral behavior under criminal governance. I argue that criminal territorial control shapes electoral outcomes by conditioning whether participation is feasible and, conditional on participation, which candidates voters support. Rather than treating turnout and vote choice as separate outcomes, the paper conceptualizes turnout as a mediating step that conditions electoral choice. Using neighborhood-level variation in criminal control over time, the study examines how voting behavior changes as neighborhoods transition between different forms of criminal governance.

- **Dalmas, Bruna.**  “Not All Justice Is Equal: Understanding Crime Outcomes Across Transitional Justice Mechanisms.”  

  <details>
  <summary><strong>Abstract</strong></summary>

  What is the effect of transitional justice mechanisms on post-conflict crime rates? While transitional justice is often associated with reductions in violence, it remains unclear whether some mechanisms are more effective than others. I argue that variation in post-conflict crime outcomes depends on the extent to which mechanisms promote accountability and institutional reform, with security sector reform and criminal trials producing more durable reductions in violence.
