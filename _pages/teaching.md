My teaching emphasizes clear communication and an approachable classroom environment. I aim to make students feel comfortable engaging with course material, participating in discussions, and reaching out with questions or concerns.

## Student Evaluations
- *"Bruna might be the best TA I've had. She did great reviews and would touch on topics that were pretty difficult. Extremely open to questions about class content or assignments. Most every lab that was dedicated to writing had a line of students wanting her input. We had a lot of freedom in our writings; for each of my themes, she showed me where to go to get the most helpful information. She also taught me how to use the online library, which I didn't even know existed. She was also very open and personable. Her labs were comfortable even on days I was completely unprepared. Incredible TA"*
  
- *"I enjoyed the lab sections more than the lecture specifically for guidance on the writing assignments. The teaching assistant did an excellent job with using all the time of the lab for both her explanations and also allowing us to ask her as many questions as needed to make sure our writing can be successful. I think the teaching assistant also took time outside of office hours to reach students about their needs and questions in the class if there was not enough time during the office hours. While that was not a requirement it really showed a level of commitment to the students and I have not had a teaching assistant show as much involvement as I did this semester during the lab sections and office hours I engaged in."*
  
- *"Bruna was an amazing TA and was extremely helpful through all assignments. She made herself available if students couldn't make it to traditional office hours and was willing to answer any questions. Bruna was extremely helpful to me personally and very understanding with me when I needed help on assignments."*
  
- *"The instructor made it a point to recommend office hours numerous times, she was clear that she actively wanted to help students as much as possible which is always much appreciated. She also gave us ample time to work on what we needed to work on, and when more direct help was required from her, she would work with different students individually which, I think, is the best way to go about teaching a lab like this. She also went above and beyond in giving feedback, I remember mentioning I wanted to go to grad school so, alongside grading my paper and giving feedback pertaining to the expectations of the class, she also talked with me in lab about how I could view my work through the lens of a grad student."*
